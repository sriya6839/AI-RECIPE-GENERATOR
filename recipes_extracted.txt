Sweet Pongal 
 
Ingredients (for two people) :-   
Moong dhal - 1/2 cup.             
Rice       - 1/2 cup.             
Milk 
Coconut  
cashew  
jaggery                                                                       
raisins (khish-mish - dry grapes)                                            
cardamom                                                           
ghee.                                                                        
                                                                             
Fry the moong dhal (before washing) till it becomes little light brown (it   
will start smelling). Then soak rice and dhal separately for 10 minutes.     
Thoroghly wash and keep it in cooker with the right water (lesser is o.k)and 
cook it seperately (in two different containers). Meanwhile cut coconut in   
very small pieces and fry in ghee. Fry cashew and raisins also separately.   
Break the jagerry and put in water (very little) and make a syrup. This is   
done because sometimes jagerry has mud and stones. After we make the syrup 
strain it through tea strainer. Put the rice and dhal in a big vessel and    
add milk (may be one  cup) and cook it till all the milk gets absorbed. Add  
jaggery syrup and again cook till even it gets absorbed. Add three big table 
spoons of ghee, powdered cardamon and cook again for a while. Add fried      
coconut, cashews and raisins.

Following is the thread test (tar) to check required consistency of syrup (chashni). If no thread is formed, but 
there is stickiness in the syrup when tested, then it is 3/4 tar (thread). This consistency is generally used in 
dipping sweets like, gulabjamoon, boondi, jalebi, imarti, etc. Boil some more and when 1 tar forms, it is used 
in soaking pancake pancakes like malpua. On further boiling two tars are obtained and this is used in sweets 
like burfis, mohanthal, etc. At this stage a drop of syrup dropped on a plate will form a soft ball when cooled. 
After this stage do no stir briskly and continuously or the sugar will recrystallise. Still further boiling will form 
2 1/2 to 3 tars and this syrup is used to get a white coating of sugar on sweets like balushahi, surti ghari, etc. 
At this stage when the syrup is dropped in a plate it will form a hard ball when cooled. Following are the steps 
shown to make sugar syrup (chashni) in the right way.  
 
a.Take sugar and water in the ratio of 2 : 1 1/2 unless other wise mentioned.  
b.Put both in a deep saucepan to boil, stirring occasionally.  
c.When the mixture comes to a boil, add 1/2 cup milk.  
d.When a thick scum is formed on the surface of syrup, it is time to strain.  
e.Always use a metal strainer or moist cloth to strain the hot syrup, never plastic.  
f.Put back to boil, checking the consistency required as above.  
g.Check frequently, because once the first thread forms, it proceeds to thicken to the next stages very quickly.  
h.Use as required in the recipe. Make syrup side by side of making the recipe, reheating the syrup too many 
times will alter the texture of the resulting sweet dish. To save time, prepare the syrup on a second burner, 
while making the rest of the recipe. This will avoid excess wastage of time and unnecessary cooling off, of the 
fried flours, etc. as the recipe demands.

2 tsp grated ginger root 
1/3 cup chopped tomatoes 
1 green chili, chopped 
1 tbspn nonfat plain yogurt 
2-3 tbsp chopped cilantro leaves 
1/2 tsp garam masala 
(see below) 
Wash, drain, and cut cauliflower into 1 inch flowerets, including stem. 
Combine chili powder, ginger, tomato, green chili, tumeric with the yogurt in  
A small bowl. Spray with pam, use nonstick pan, use a little water, whatever 
you do to nonstick yourself. Put Cauliflower into pan then pour spices over 
the top. Cover pan tightly and cook over LOW heat for 10-15 minutes  
(Cauliflower will steam in the spicy mixture). Stir in half the cilantro 
leaves, increase heat to medium, and cook with lid off, for another 5-6 
minutes, to drive off excess moisture. turn off heat and sprinkle with  
garam masala and reamaining cilantro. Make sure all liquid is driven off, 
serve with basmati rice. 4 servings, less than 98 calories 
 
GARAM MASALA 
2 oz. black cardamom pods, 1 oz piece of cinnamon stick, 1 oz. cloves,  
2 oz. peppercorns 
Heat a heavy skillet, reduce heat, add pods and cinnamon. Move them around 
for two minutes. Add clves and peppercorn, and shuffle for another minute. 
Turn off heat, but continue shuffling until the heat is out of the pan. 
Pour roasted spices into grinder and grind til you have a fine powder. 
If not fine, strain it, and discard what won't pass through strainer. 
 
187. Garam Masala 
5 tsp coriander seeds   1 Tbsp. cumin seeds     1 Tbsp black peppercorns 
1 tsp whole cloves      1 tsp cinnamon          1 tsp green cardomon pods 
 
toast coriander and cumin seeds for 3-5 min.  combine w/other ingredients and 
grind in mortar/pestle (or blender which works great for me).  Store in a 
bottle for up to 6 months.  This is a great spice mixture!  But normly I don't 
have those spices on hand so I cook without it.  But you might consider it 
worth investing in as its a neat combination of spices for cooking.

one cup maida  
1/2 cup rice flour

2-3 chopped onions  
a bunch cashews  
oil to make dosas  
Method 
• 
Mix rava, maida, rice flour together into a thick batter adding little water at a time so no lumps are 
formed. Mixing by hand is a good idea if you don't have a whisk or electric mixer. Add salt, crushed 
cumin asafoetida and leave in a warm spot for six to seven hours at least.  
• 
When ready to eat, spray a non-stick pan lightly with oil and warm.

www.MyKashmir.in  
Page 144 
 
• 
Sprinkle some of the cut onions and cashews onto the pan and now continuing on low-medium heat, 
drizzle the batter such that there is a latice work effect. A lot of holes is just the thing. Dribble a bit 
bit of oil around it and when the edges start turning brown coax it off the pan with a flat, wide spatula 
and flip it over. Remove in a few minutes and make more.  
• 
For the plain rava dosa leave out the onions.

250. Basic Curry Sauce 
Ingredients  
 
• 
3 tablespoons vegetable oil or ghee (clarified butter)  
• 
1 medium onion - finely chopped  
• 
4 cloves garlic - peeled and sliced  
• 
1.5 inch piece root ginger - peeled and thinly sliced (it should look about the same volume as the 
garlic)  
• 
(optional) 2 mild fleshy green chillies - de-seeded and veined then chopped  
• 
half teaspoon turmeric powder  
• 
half teaspoon ground cumin seed  
• 
half teaspoon ground coriander seed  
• 
5 tablespoons plain passata (smooth, thick, sieved tomatoes, US = purée) or 1 tablespoon 
concentrated tomato purée (US = paste) mixed with 4 tablespoons water  
Method  
Heat the oil in a heavy pan then add the chopped onion and stir for a few minutes with the heat on high.  
Add the ginger, garlic and green chilli (if using). Stir for 30 seconds then put the heat down to very low.  
Cook for 15 minutes stirring from time to time making sure nothing browns or burns.  
www.MyKashmir.in  
Page 145 
 
Add the turmeric, cumin and coriander and cook, still very gently, for a further 5 minutes. Don't burn the 
spices or the sauce will taste horrid - sprinkle on a few drops of water if you're worried.  
Take off the heat and cool a little. Put 4 fl oz cold water in a blender, add the contents of the pan and 
whizz until very smooth. Add the passata and stir.  
Put the puréed mixture back into the pan and cook for 20 - 30 minutes (the longer the better) over very 
low heat stirring occasionally. You can add a little hot water if it starts to catch on the pan but the 
idea is to gently "fry" the sauce which will darken in colour to an orangy brown. The final texture 
should be something like good tomato ketchup. Warning - it WILL gloop occasionally and splatter 
over your cooker, it's the price you have to pay!

safron into it. Pour the milf/safron mixture over the rice. Dot generously with ghee. To garnish spread the fried 
onions and corriander over the rice.  
Cover the saucepan tightly. Allow to steam on high heat for about 10 minutes and then lower the heat and 
cook for another 1 and a half to 2 hours. Before removing the pan from the cookeer ensure that there is no 
moisture left in the meat. This can be checked by simply listening for a sizling sound. If there is no sizzling
